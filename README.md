### What I learned

While solving this challenge, I have aquired a lot of skills.

- also understand how to customize the bootstrap styles.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me in styling the bootstrap rules. It is Bootstrap site.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google.com) - And this is the main helper for almost everything, it is easier to directly search on google rather than specific code element search.
